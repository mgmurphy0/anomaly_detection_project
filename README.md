# Before running the code:

Download the images and make sure they are in the "anomaly\_dataset" folder
Create your conda environment using the environment.yml
Ensure your local repository has the "models" and "plots" subdirectories so outputs can be saved off. If they are not present, you should manually create them before running the code.

# Running the code
To train and test the suite of configurations, run main.py.
To run initial image exploration checks, use image\_exploration.py

# Notes
Within main.py, there are conditional blocks of code to train/save models, evaluate models, and produce plots. These are all true by default.
Model parameters can be found in the configs folder.
All models will need to be retrained because a few will not fit in git due to size constraints. I have them saved locally if needed to reference.
